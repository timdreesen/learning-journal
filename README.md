# LIVE DEMO [https://velvety-lamington-11b1bc.netlify.app/](https://velvety-lamington-11b1bc.netlify.app/)


This is a solo project from the 'Responsive Design' course of the coding school Scrimba. The assignment was to build a responsive website based on a [design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hE5klIn1AEQ9XWZWmurs7y/Learning-Journal-Blog).
The two breakpoints given were 'mobile' and 'desktop'. At a later point I might add 'tablet' breakpoint and some Js to make this project feel more complete. However it does meet all the requirements at the moment.

## Requirements:

- Build each page from scratch
- Make all pages responsive
    - Relative Units
    - Mobile-first design
    - Media queries
    - Viewport meta tag
- Follow the design spec
